             a 17-year-old front-end developer passionate about crafting clean, responsive, and engaging web experiences.<br>
             I’m currently pursuing my higher studies at AKTU University, where I’m deepening my understanding of computer science and modern web technologies.<br>
             I love turning ideas into interactive interfaces.<br>
             Every project I work on is a chance to learn something new and push my creativity further — and I’m just getting started!
             <br><br>
             the above text was copy paste from gpt<br><br><br>
             I wanted to make a portfolio website for my freelancing gig this site is incomplete and i don't think i'm going to continue working on this main reason being that it is a cheap copy of sharyap.com the layout is not original.
            <br><br>
            The reason why i decided to copy her website is cause it had such a great design, it was simple and interactive i absolutely loved the drag function and 
            but its just mine doesnt feel like me or the type of site i envisioned.<br><br><br>
            but i did spend like  9-10 days to make it so i will probably post this on my git.

        <p>
            I absolutely with all my heart love zelda games. <br>
            I've played total of 5 zelda games : <br>
            The first one i played was <strong>THE MINISH CAPE</strong> <br>
            When i played it for the first time it blew my mind (i mean i have played lots of pokemon games but i was really small at that time and didn't really asked myself how is this game working) <br>
            It was a really good game and this was the reason i got into the zelda franchise <br><br>
            THE NEXT GAME WAS ,"TWILIGHT PRINCESS game cube version" <br><br>
            IT was the <strong>best</strong> i know it got lot of hate but i loved the game and the manga was awesome and obviously the best scene was <br> when midna needed help to get back to zelda. <br>
            i legit panicked my eys were glued to the screen 10/10.
            <br><br><br>
            THE NEXT IN LINE WAS ,'WIND WAKER'
            it was cool but shifting from dark to toon didn't suit me that well great game.
            <br><br><br>
            THE NEXT WAS ,'breath of the wild'
            ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT 10/10
            <br><br>
            LAST ONE ,'TEARS OF THE KINGDOM'
            peak
            <br><br><br>
            My personal ratings are : <br><br>
            1. TWILIGHT PRINCESS <br>
            2. TEARS OF THE KINGDOM <br>
            3. BREATH OF THE WILD <br>
            4. MINISH CAPE <br>
            5. WIND WAKETR

        <p>Hi my name is harsh, the reason why i started doing front end or u can say freelancing or why i wanna start free lancing is cause i wanna buy i <strong>switch 2</strong> so that i can play tears of the kingdom in 60fps.
            my parents arn't going to buy one for me cause they bought me the switch like 2 years ago so i thought if i start making websites for people i  could save up.
            i would likely not use this as my actual portfolio since its a cheap copy of sharyap.com
            <br>
            i am going to start working on something that more like me <br>
            At last thanks for reading this / visiting.
